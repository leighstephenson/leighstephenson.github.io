  <h2> Introduction </h2>
   
  <h3> A little bit about me: </h3>
  
  <p> Hello! I am a highly motivated, focused, and disciplined indivdual. When I set my mind to something, I try to plan every step of what it will take to achieve that goal.
   Applying to the Prime Academy is just one step in the process that will hopefully lead me to achieve future goals. My full-time job is centered around extremely meticulous responsibilities, 
   so I am very confident that I will be able to handle the tedious nature of coding as a career. I do have a fews years of basic coding experience from high-school and
   college, but have been out of practice since around 2017. Regardless of my time off from coding, I am eager to pick up where I left off and continue learning. </p>
