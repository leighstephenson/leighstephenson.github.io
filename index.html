  <h3> A little bit about me: </h3>
  
  <p> Hello! I am a highly motivated indivdual and when I set my mind to something, I plan every step of how I can achieve that goal. My full-time job is centered around extremely meticulous responsibilities, so I am very confident that I will be able to handle the tedious nature of coding as a career.
   I do have a fews years of basic coding experience in high-school and college, but have been out of practice since around 2017. Regardless of my time off from coding, I am eager to pick up where I left off and continue learning. </p>
